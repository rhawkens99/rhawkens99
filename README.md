I'm Richard DeYoung. I am a Senior at Central Washigton University, and will be graduating in March 2022.

I have explored a lot of languages since learning Java in 2017. These include JavaScript, C++, Python, SQL, SML, and Prolog.

Any kind of Software Development interests me; I love creating things and solving problems.
