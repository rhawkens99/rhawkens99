Hi! 

I'm Richard DeYoung, a Software Engineer employed at [Envorso](https://envorso.com/). My specialization is in Back-end development, but I have experience creating very simple Front-end interfaces and want to learn more.

I have been coding since learning Java in 2017. Since then, I have gained profiency in C++, Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, and Dart. The frameworks I am most experienced in are Express.JS, Flutter, and React. 

You can contact me at: richard@deyoungzone.com or on my linkedin.
